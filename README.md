<h1> This is my first Javascript exercise.</h1>
<br>
<p> This was a hard exercise, because it was the first time for me.<p>
At the beginning a had to google a lot, but after a while I found some useful stuff.</p>

<h3> What was the hardest thing ? </h3>
<br>
<p> Every thing! I don't know where to start. It's a very logical programming language, but you have to know what you are doing. Otherwise you will get stuck. Hard ! <p>
